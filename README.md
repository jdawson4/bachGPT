This project is seeking to continue one of my first projects I ever undertook in computer science, which involved stringing together a series of applications I didn't understand in order to teach an AI to write music. The original project (please don't look at it) can be found here: https://github.com/jdawson4/csv_music. Now that I have a fancy degree, I want to give this a proper go, write my own code for pulling data from midis, create my own autoregressive transformer model in keras, and iterate on the training process in order to make a full music-generating model all by myself!
